<!-- Privacy Policy -->

<p>ResiliencePro is provided by Calisthenics Online, LLC hereinafter referred to as 'ResiliencePro'. This data protection declaration provides information on how we use and protect your data on ResiliencePro. Using ResiliencePro implies that you accept the terms set forth in this data protection declaration. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use ResiliencePro. This data protection declaration applies to all members from the time they first log in at ResiliencePro, thereby acknowledging acceptance of this data protection declaration.</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<p>The concept of the ResiliencePro online platform and mobile apps and network relies to a great extent on the publication of information regarding individual users to other users by making them accessible via the ResiliencePro mobile application. All users can freely access the public profile information (picture, first name, last name, and location), training information (workout times and repetitions), and network information (followings and followers) of all other users. ResiliencePro application users do not have the option to change that. Also, names and training information of users will be used for ResiliencePro leaderboards inside the application that can be displayed by all users.</p>

<p>By using the application, users explicitly consent that other users may see the information named above and it may be used for ResiliencePro leaderboards.</p>

<p>If users do not want other users to get access to their information, they have to leave their profile empty and they have to make sure to not save any workouts. If they accidentally do so, they have to delete them in their profile.</p>

<p>Email addresses will not be shared with any other user unless made publicly available via a user's profile intentionally.</p>

<p>They may, however, be automatically added to the ResiliencePro mailing lists. From time to time ResiliencePro may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys, or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt-out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.</p>
